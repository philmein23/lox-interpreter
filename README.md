# Lox Interpreter

A project using "Crafting Interpreter" as the source material to create the Lox tree walking interpreter using Rust. Why I'm I doing this? First, I have a overwhelming desire to learn what goes on underneath the hood of the construction of a programming language using a host langauge. Second, I've long set my sights on learning Rust for a while now, and I felt like learning how interpreters work through the lens of Rust will allow me knock two birds with one stone.
